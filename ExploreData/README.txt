# README

This directory contains 3 files that can be used to visualise the 'Adverse Weather Scenarios for Future Electricity Systems' dataset. The user will need to change to file location within the code:

1. LoadInData_example.R - This script loads in an event from the dataset and plots the wind, solar and temperature data in different ways in R
2. LoadInData_example.py - Equivalent for Python
3. LoadInData_example_notebook.ipynb - Similar as a Python notebook
